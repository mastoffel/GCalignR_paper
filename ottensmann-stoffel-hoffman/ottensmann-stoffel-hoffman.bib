 abstract = {Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is widely used for comparative replicate sample analysis in proteomics, lipidomics and metabolomics. Before statistical comparison, registration must be established to match corresponding analytes from run to run. Alignment, the most popular correspondence approach, consists of constructing a function that warps the content of runs to most closely match a given reference sample. To date, dozens of correspondence algorithms have been proposed, creating a daunting challenge for practitioners in algorithm selection. Yet, existing reviews have highlighted only a few approaches. In this review, we describe 50 correspondence algorithms to facilitate practical algorithm selection. We elucidate the motivation for correspondence and analyze the limitations of current approaches, which include prohibitive runtimes, numerous user parameters, model limitations and the need for reference samples. We suggest and describe a paradigm shift for overcoming current correspondence limitations by building on known liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry behavior.},

@article{Struck.2012,
 abstract = {The purpose of this work was to develop a new aligning algorithm called supervised alignment and to compare its performance with the correlation optimized warping. The supervised alignment is based on a {\dq}supervised{\dq} selection of a few common peaks presented on each chromatogram. The selected peaks are aligned based on a difference in the retention time of the selected analytes in the sample and the reference chromatogram. The retention times of the fragments between known peaks are subsequently linearly interpolated. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been tested on a series of simulated and experimental chromatograms. The simulated chromatograms comprised analytes with a systematic or random retention time shifts. The experimental chromatographic (RP-HPLC) data have been obtained during the analysis of nucleosides from 208 urine samples and consists of both the systematic and random displacements. All the data sets have been aligned using the correlation optimized warping and the supervised alignment. The time required to complete the alignment, the overall complexity of both algorithms, and its performance measured by the average correlation coefficients are compared to assess performance of tested methods. In the case of systematic shifts, both methods lead to the successful alignment. However, for random shifts, the correlation optimized warping in comparison to the supervised alignment requires more time (few hours versus few minutes) and the quality of the alignment described as correlation coefficient of the newly aligned matrix is worse 0.8593 versus 0.9629. For the experimental dataset supervised alignment successfully aligns 208 samples using 10 prior identified peaks. The knowledge about retention times of few analytes' in the data sets is necessary to perform the supervised alignment for both systematic and random shifts. The supervised alignment method is faster, more effective and simpler preprocessing method than the correlation optimized warping method and can be applied to the chromatographic and electrophoretic data sets.},

@article{Tsai.2013,
 abstract = {MOTIVATION: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been widely used for profiling expression levels of biomolecules in various '-omic' studies including proteomics, metabolomics and glycomics. Appropriate LC-MS data preprocessing steps are needed to detect true differences between biological groups. Retention time (RT) alignment, which is required to ensure that ion intensity measurements among multiple LC-MS runs are comparable, is one of the most important yet challenging preprocessing steps. Current alignment approaches estimate RT variability using either single chromatograms or detected peaks, but do not simultaneously take into account the complementary information embedded in the entire LC-MS data. RESULTS: We propose a Bayesian alignment model for LC-MS data analysis. The alignment model provides estimates of the RT variability along with uncertainty measures. The model enables integration of multiple sources of information including internal standards and clustered chromatograms in a mathematically rigorous framework. We apply the model to LC-MS metabolomic, proteomic and glycomic data. The performance of the model is evaluated based on ground-truth data, by measuring correlation of variation, RT difference across runs and peak-matching performance. We demonstrate that Bayesian alignment model improves significantly the RT alignment performance through appropriate integration of relevant information. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MATLAB code, raw and preprocessed LC-MS data are available at http://omics.georgetown.edu/alignLCMS.html. CONTACT: hwr@georgetown.edu.

@article{Tuttle.2014,
 abstract = {Evidence for the the ability of birds to detect olfactory signals is now well documented, yet it remains unclear whether birds secrete chemicals that can be used as social cues. A potential source of chemical cues in birds is the secretion from the uropygial gland, or preen gland, which is thought to waterproof, maintain, and protect feathers from ectoparasites. However, it is possible that preen oil also may be used for individual recognition, mate choice, and signalling social/sexual status. If preen oil secretions can be used as socio-olfactory signals, we should be able to identify the volatile components that could make the secretions more detectable, determine the seasonality of these secretions, and determine whether olfactory signals differ among relevant social groups. We examined the seasonal differences in volatile compounds of the preen oil of captive white-throated sparrows, Zonotrichia albicollis. This species is polymorphic and has genetically determined morphs that occur in both sexes. Mating is almost exclusively disassortative with respect to morph, suggesting strong mate choice. By sampling the preen oil from captive birds in breeding and non-breeding conditions, we identified candidate chemical signals that varied according to season, sex, morph, and species. Linear alcohols with a 10-18 carbon chains, as well as methyl ketones and carboxylic acids, were the most abundant volatile compounds. Both the variety and abundances of some of these compounds were different between the sexes and morphs, with one morph secreting more volatile compounds in the non-breeding season than the other. In addition, 12 compounds were seasonally elevated in amount, and were secreted in high amounts in males. Finally, we found that preen oil signatures tended to be species-specific, with white-throated sparrows differing from the closely related Junco in the abundances and/or prevalence of at least three compounds. Our data suggest roles for preen oil secretions and avian olfaction in both non-social as well as social interactions.},

@article{Vu.2013,
 abstract = {One of the most significant challenges in the comparative analysis of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolome profiles is the occurrence of shifts between peaks across different spectra, for example caused by fluctuations in pH, temperature, instrument factors and ion content. Proper alignment of spectral peaks is therefore often a crucial preprocessing step prior to downstream quantitative analysis. Various alignment methods have been developed specifically for this purpose. Other methods were originally developed to align other data types (GC, LC, SELDI-MS, etc.), but can also be applied to NMR data. This review discusses the available methods, as well as related problems such as reference determination or the evaluation of alignment quality. We present a generic alignment framework that allows for comparison and classification of different alignment approaches according to their algorithmic principles, and we discuss their performance.},

@article{Wang.2013,
 abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the dominant technological platform for proteomics. An LC-MS analysis of a complex biological sample can be visualized as a 'map' of which the positional coordinates are the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and chromatographic retention time (RT) of the chemical species profiled. Label-free quantitative proteomics requires the alignment and comparison of multiple LC-MS maps to ascertain the reproducibility of experiments or reveal proteome changes under different conditions. The main challenge in this task lies in correcting inevitable RT shifts. Similar, but not identical, LC instruments and settings can cause peptides to elute at very different times and sometimes in a different order, violating the assumptions of many state-of-the-art alignment tools. To meet this challenge, we developed LWBMatch, a new algorithm based on weighted bipartite matching. Unlike existing tools, which search for accurate warping functions to correct RT shifts, we directly seek a peak-to-peak mapping by maximizing a global similarity function between two LC-MS maps. For alignment tasks with large RT shifts ({\textgreater}500 s), an approximate warping function is determined by locally weighted scatterplot smoothing of potential matched features, detected using a novel voting scheme based on co-elution. For validation, we defined the ground truth for alignment success based on tandem mass spectrometry identifications from sequence searching. We showed that our method outperforms several existing tools in terms of precision and recall, and is capable of aligning maps from different instruments and settings.

 abstract = {Until recently, the use of olfactory signals in birds has been largely ignored, despite the fact that birds do possess a fully functioning olfactory system and have been shown to use odours in social and foraging tasks, predator detection and orientation. The present study investigates whether carrion crows (Corvus corone corone), a bird species living in complex social societies, respond behaviourally to olfactory cues of conspecifics. During our experiment, carrion crows were observed less often close to the conspecific scent compared to a control side. Because conspecific scent was extracted during handling, a stressful procedure for birds, we interpreted the general avoidance of the 'scent' side as disfavour against a stressed conspecific. However, males, unlike females, showed less avoidance towards the scent of a familiar individual compared to an unfamiliar one, which might reflect a stronger interest in the information conveyed and/or willingness to provide social support.},

The alignment is performed in a z-score transformed retention time domain to standardize chromatographic peak distribution across samples. A mixture score is developed to assess the similarity between two peaks by simultaneously evaluating the mass spectral similarity and the closeness of retention time. An analysis of experimental data acquired under three different flow rates indicates that the proposed method is able to correctly align the heterogeneous data. The effectiveness of method is further validated by analyzing experimental data of multiple mixtures of metabolite extract from mouse liver with 28 spiked-in acids. All of the detected spiked-in acids were correctly aligned. A statistical test correctly detected the concentration differences of the spiked-in compounds between sample groups using the alignment table. The area under curve (AUC) value in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is larger than 0.85 in all three of the compared sample groups, indicating a high accuracy of peak alignment and supporting the potential application of the proposed method for metabolomics projects such as biomarker discovery.},

 abstract = {Retention time shift is one of the most challenging problems during the preprocessing of massive chromatographic datasets. Here, an improved version of the moving window fast Fourier transform cross-correlation algorithm is presented to perform nonlinear and robust alignment of chromatograms by analyzing the shifts matrix generated by moving window procedure. The shifts matrix in retention time can be estimated by fast Fourier transform cross-correlation with a moving window procedure. The refined shift of each scan point can be obtained by calculating the mode of corresponding column of the shifts matrix. This version is simple, but more effective and robust than the previously published moving window fast Fourier transform cross-correlation method. It can handle nonlinear retention time shift robustly if proper window size has been selected. The window size is the only one parameter needed to adjust and optimize. The properties of the proposed method are investigated by comparison with the previous moving window fast Fourier transform cross-correlation and recursive alignment by fast Fourier transform using chromatographic datasets. The pattern recognition results of a gas chromatography mass spectrometry dataset of metabolic syndrome can be improved significantly after preprocessing by this method. Furthermore, the proposed method is available as an open source package at https://github.com/zmzhang/MWFFT2.},

 abstract = {During the past 2 decades, considerable progress has been made in the study of bird semiochemistry, and our goal was to review and evaluate this literature with particular emphasis on the volatile organic constituents. Indeed, since the importance of social chemosignaling in birds is becoming more and more apparent, the search for molecules involved in chemical communication is of critical interest. These molecules can be found in different sources that include uropygial gland secretions, feather-surface compounds, and molecules from feces and skin. Although many studies have examined the chemical substances secreted by birds, research on bird chemical communication is still at the start, so new strategies for collecting samples and development of new methods of analysis are urgently required. As a first step, we built a database that brings together potential semiochemicals, using a unique chemical nomenclature for comparing different bird species and also for referencing the different classes of substances that can be found in order to adapt future parameters of analysis. The most important patterns of the wax fraction of preen secretions are highlighted and organized in an ordered table. We also draw up a list of various combinations of sampling and analytical techniques, so that each method can be compared at a glance.},

@article{Christin.2010,
 abstract = {Time alignment of complex LC-MS data remains a challenge in proteomics and metabolomics studies. This work describes modifications of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the Parametric Time Warping (PTW) algorithms that improve the alignment quality for complex, highly variable LC-MS data sets. Regular DTW or PTW use one-dimensional profiles such as the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) or Base Peak Chromatogram (BPC) resulting in correct alignment if the signals have a relatively simple structure. However, when aligning the TICs of chromatograms from complex mixtures with large concentration variability such as serum or urine, both algorithms often lead to misalignment of peaks and thus incorrect comparisons in the subsequent statistical analysis. This is mainly due to the fact that compounds with different m/z values but similar retention times are not considered separately but confounded in the benefit function of the algorithms using only one-dimensional information. Thus, it is necessary to treat the information of different mass traces separately in the warping function to ensure that compounds having the same m/z value and retention time are aligned to each other. The Component Detection Algorithm (CODA) is widely used to calculate the quality of an LC-MS mass trace. By combining CODA with the warping algorithms of DTW or PTW (DTW-CODA or PTW-CODA), we include only high quality mass traces measured by CODA in the benefit function. Our results show that using several CODA selected high quality mass traces in DTW-CODA and PTW-CODA significantly improves the alignment quality of three different, highly complex LC-MS data sets. Moreover, DTW-CODA leads to better preservation of peak shape as compared to the original DTW-TIC algorithm, which often suffers from a substantial peak shape distortion. Our results show that combination of CODA selected mass traces with different time alignment algorithm is a general principle that provide accurate alignment for highly complex samples with large concentration variability.},

 abstract = {A general framework for the automatic alignment of one-dimensional chromatographic signals is presented in this article. The alignment of signals was achieved by explicitly modeling the warping function. Its shape was estimated using a linear combination of several B-spline functions. The coefficients of the spline functions were found in the course of an optimization procedure to maximize the Pearson's correlation coefficient between a target chromatogram and aligned chromatogram(s). The computational requirements of the method are discussed with respect to the correlation optimized warping method, frequently used for the alignment of chromatographic signals. As illustrated with two sets of one-dimensional chromatographic fingerprints, the automatic alignment approach performs well even when non-linear peak shifts need to be corrected. It can be applied in an on-the-fly manner since the alignment of signals is rapid.},

A warp function approach has the advantage that overlapping peaks are easily dealt with compared to other proposed two-dimensional algorithms. Another advantage is that missing peaks are allowed if the absence of these peaks has little numerical effect on the warp function computation and if these peaks occur between existing peaks.

We investigated the chemical composition of echidna secretions, including cloacal swabs and solid, {\dq}waxy{\dq} exudates from the cloaca and spurs. Scent samples from 37 individuals were collected over a 1-year period and analyzed using a range of different analytical techniques. A total of 186 compounds were identified, including volatile carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, methyl esters, ethyl esters, terpenes, nitrogen- and sulphur-containing compounds, alcohols, and aromatics. Long chain and very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids, sterols, and sterol esters were identified as the major constituents of solid exudates, some of which have not previously been described from any animal skin gland. There was a high degree of composition overlap between male and female cloaca swabs; however, there is significant variation, which could mediate echidna mating behavior. Many of the volatile and nonvolatile chemicals detected are used for communication in other species, suggesting that chemical signals have important and diverse functions in echidna social interactions.},

Although a number of RT alignment software has been reported, the performance of these software packages have not been comprehensively evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the RT alignment accuracy of publicly available and commercial RT alignment software. Two gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) datasets acquired from a mixture of standard metabolites and human bladder cancer urine samples, were used to assess three publicly available software packages, MetAlign, MZmine and TagFinder, and two commercial applications comprising the Calibration feature and Statistical Compare of ChromaTOF software. The overall RT alignment accuracies in aligning standard compounds mixture were 93, 92, 74, 73 and 42{\%} for Calibration feature, MZmine, MetAlign, Statistical Compare and TagFinder, respectively. Additionally, unique trends were observed for the individual software with regards to the different experimental conditions related to extent and direction of RT shifts. Conflicting performance was observed for human urine samples suggesting that RT misalignments still occurred despite the use of RT alignment software. While RT alignment remains an inevitable step in data preprocessing, metabonomic researchers are recommended to perform manual check on the RT alignment of important biomarkers as part of their validation process.},

@article{Luedemann.2008,
 abstract = {MOTIVATION: Typical GC-MS-based metabolite profiling experiments may comprise hundreds of chromatogram files, which each contain up to 1000 mass spectral tags (MSTs). MSTs are the characteristic patterns of approximately 25-250 fragment ions and respective isotopomers, which are generated after gas chromatography (GC) by electron impact ionization (EI) of the separated chemical molecules. These fragment ions are subsequently detected by time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). MSTs of profiling experiments are typically reported as a list of ions, which are characterized by mass, chromatographic retention index (RI) or retention time (RT), and arbitrary abundance. The first two parameters allow the identification, the later the quantification of the represented chemical compounds. Many software tools have been reported for the pre-processing, the so-called curve resolution and deconvolution, of GC-(EI-TOF)-MS files. Pre-processing tools generate numerical data matrices, which contain all aligned MSTs and samples of an experiment. This process, however, is error prone mainly due to (i) the imprecise RI or RT alignment of MSTs and (ii) the high complexity of biological samples. This complexity causes co-elution of compounds and as a consequence non-selective, in other words impure MSTs. The selection and validation of optimal fragment ions for the specific and selective quantification of simultaneously eluting compounds is, therefore, mandatory. Currently validation is performed in most laboratories under human supervision. So far no software tool supports the non-targeted and user-independent quality assessment of the data matrices prior to statistical analysis. TagFinder may fill this gap. STRATEGY: TagFinder facilitates the analysis of all fragment ions, which are observed in GC-(EI-TOF)-MS profiling experiments. The non-targeted approach allows the discovery of novel and unexpected compounds. In addition, mass isotopomer resolution is maintained by TagFinder processing. This feature is essential for metabolic flux analyses and highly useful, but not required for metabolite profiling. Whenever possible, TagFinder gives precedence to chemical means of standardization, for example, the use of internal reference compounds for retention time calibration or quantitative standardization. In addition, external standardization is supported for both compound identification and calibration. The workflow of TagFinder comprises, (i) the import of fragment ion data, namely mass, time and arbitrary abundance (intensity), from a chromatography file interchange format or from peak lists provided by other chromatogram pre-processing software, (ii) the annotation of sample information and grouping of samples into classes, (iii) the RI calculation, (iv) the binning of observed fragment ions of equal mass from different chromatograms into RI windows, (v) the combination of these bins, so-called mass tags, into time groups of co-eluting fragment ions, (vi) the test of time groups for intensity correlated mass tags, (vii) the data matrix generation and (viii) the extraction of selective mass tags supported by compound identification. Thus, TagFinder supports both non-targeted fingerprinting analyses and metabolite targeted profiling. AVAILABILITY: Exemplary TagFinder workspaces and test data sets are made available upon request to the contact authors.

Despite its importance, there is very little empirical support for such a mechanism in nature. Here we provide data that the nest-mate recognition mechanism in an ant is based on a colony-specific Z9-alkene signature, proving that surface chemicals are indeed used in ant nest-mate recognition as was suggested 100 years ago. We investigated the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of 10 Formica exsecta colonies that are composed almost entirely of a Z9-alkene and alkane component. Then we showed that worker aggression is only elicited by the Z9-alkene part. This was confirmed using synthetic Z9-alkene and alkane blends matched to the individual colony profiles of the two most different chemical colonies. In both colonies, only glass beads with 'nest-mate' alkene profiles received reduced aggression. Finally, changing the abundance of a single Z9-alkene on live ants was shown to significantly increase the aggression they received from nest-mates in all five colonies tested. Our data suggest that nest-mate discrimination in the social insects has evolved to rely upon highly sensitive responses to relatively few compounds.},

@article{Hoffmann.2012,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modern analytical methods in biology and chemistry use separation techniques coupled to sensitive detectors, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These hyphenated methods provide high-dimensional data. Comparing such data manually to find corresponding signals is a laborious task, as each experiment usually consists of thousands of individual scans, each containing hundreds or even thousands of distinct signals. In order to allow for successful identification of metabolites or proteins within such data, especially in the context of metabolomics and proteomics, an accurate alignment and matching of corresponding features between two or more experiments is required. Such a matching algorithm should capture fluctuations in the chromatographic system which lead to non-linear distortions on the time axis, as well as systematic changes in recorded intensities. Many different algorithms for the retention time alignment of GC-MS and LC-MS data have been proposed and published, but all of them focus either on aligning previously extracted peak features or on aligning and comparing the complete raw data containing all available features. RESULTS: In this paper we introduce two algorithms for retention time alignment of multiple GC-MS datasets: multiple alignment by bidirectional best hits peak assignment and cluster extension (BIPACE) and center-star multiple alignment by pairwise partitioned dynamic time warping (CeMAPP-DTW). We show how the similarity-based peak group matching method BIPACE may be used for multiple alignment calculation individually and how it can be used as a preprocessing step for the pairwise alignments performed by CeMAPP-DTW. We evaluate the algorithms individually and in combination on a previously published small GC-MS dataset studying the Leishmania parasite and on a larger GC-MS dataset studying grains of wheat (Triticum aestivum). CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that BIPACE achieves very high precision and recall and a very low number of false positive peak assignments on both evaluation datasets. CeMAPP-DTW finds a high number of true positives when executed on its own, but achieves even better results when BIPACE is used to constrain its search space. The source code of both algorithms is included in the OpenSource software framework Maltcms, which is available from http://maltcms.sf.net. The evaluation scripts of the present study are available from the same source.},

Preprocessing, especially peak alignment, is a time-consuming task prior to the extraction of useful information from the datasets by chemometrics and statistics. To accurately and rapidly align shift peaks among one-dimensional chromatograms, multiscale peak alignment (MSPA) is presented in this research. Peaks of each chromatogram were detected based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and aligned against a reference chromatogram from large to small scale gradually, and the aligning procedure is accelerated by fast Fourier transform cross correlation. The presented method was compared with two widely used alignment methods on chromatographic dataset, which demonstrates that MSPA can preserve the shapes of peaks and has an excellent speed during alignment. Furthermore, MSPA method is robust and not sensitive to noise and baseline. MSPA was implemented and is available at http://code.google.com/p/mspa.},
